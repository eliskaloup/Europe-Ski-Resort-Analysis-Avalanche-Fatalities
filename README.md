# European Ski Resorts Overview: Avalanche Fatalities and Snow Accumulation Insights

## Ski Resort and Avalanche Analysis in 14 European Countries

This project provides an analysis of ski resorts across 14 European countries, focusing on key elements like pricing, slope difficulty, lift types, avalanche incidents, and snow accumulation.


## Ski Resort Analysis:

Pricing and Infrastructure: Includes the average price of adult ski passes and total number of slopes.
Slope Difficulty Levels: Breakdown of slopes by difficulty—blue (easy), red (intermediate), and black (advanced).
Lift Types and Quantities: Assessment of lift types by country and resort.


## Avalanche Fatalities Analysis (2018–2022):

Incident Details: Covers avalanche locations, primary and secondary hazards.
Victim Information: Data on group involvement, number of fatalities, and activities undertaken during the avalanche events.


## Snow Accumulation (2022 Focus):

Snow Depth and Duration: Highlights areas with a minimum of 50 cm of natural snow and the average days it remains on the ground.
Limitations: Only high-snow days (+50 cm) are included due to data size constraints, making this a partial analysis of European snow accumulation.
This summary provides insight into the landscape, safety, and snowfall characteristics of European ski regions.
